	abstract = {The research reported is an investigation into the early acquisition of grammar by three children from the age of approximately 19 months. Previous psycholinguistic studies of child language in this period had revealed the orderly arrangements of words, but described only the form of early sentences and not their linguistic function or meaning. In this study, in contrast, nonlinguistic information from situational and behavioral context was used to infer the semantic intent of the children’s utterances for analyzing the development of early grammar. Judgments of semantic intent made it possible to describe the inherent structure of early word combinations so that conclusions could be drawn about the children's knowledge of semantic-syntactic relationship in the derivation of sentences. The development of the semantics and syntax of negation was described further until mean length of utterance approached 3.0 morphemes and the children were about 28 months old. Attending to what the children said in relation to what they were talking about−the situation and behavior that cooccurred with what they said−led to the conclusion that language acquisition is critically related to developments in cognition, perception, and a child’s interaction in a world of objects, events, and relations. Other conclusions concerned constraints that appeared to operate on the developing length and complexity of utterances, and the different strategies the children used in their approaches to learning the language. A large body of data is presented in support of these conclusions with an extensive catalog of the children's earliest two-word utterances, negative sentences, and syntactic and single-word lexicons.},

The relative extent of imitation and the lexical and the grammatical variation between imitative and spontaneous speech were determined. There were inter-subject differences in the extent of imitation, but each child was consistent in the tendency to imitate or not to imitate across time. For those children who imitated, there were both lexical and grammatical differences in imitative and spontaneous speech, and a developmental shift from imitative to spontaneous use of particular words and semantic-syntactic relations between words. The results are discussed as evidence of an active processing of model utterances relative to the contexts in which they occur for information for language learning.},

In the last decade there has been a shift to the view that exposure to isolated words is unreliable and plays little if any role in early word learning. This study revisits the role of isolated words. The results show (a) that isolated words are a reliable feature of speech to infants, (b) that they include a variety of word types, many of which are repeated in close temporal proximity, (c) that a substantial fraction of the words infants produce are words that mothers speak in isolation, and (d) that the frequency with which a child hears a word in isolation predicts whether that word will be learned better than the child's total frequency of exposure to that word. Thus, exposure to isolated words may signi®cantly facilitate vocabulary development at its earliest stages. q 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Early child phonology was studied using phonetically transcribed samples that six parents provided of their children's vocalizations, beginning when the children were about 11 months old and continuing to four years of age. The primary study objective was to obtain a sufficient amount of longitudinal data from several children to support a detailed charting of early phonological development. Over 30,000 utterances have been collected and tabulated. Analyses are provided on onset and acquisition of multiple-word utterances, acquisition of phonological features, metathesis, and anomalous sound changes. Computer-assisted data analysis was undertaken, and the stored linguistic information incorporates details on initial and final consonants and consonant clusters, tags marking each  utterance for reduplication, assimilation, metathesis, intervocalic consonants, "strange" vowels, and phrase context. Two phonological studies were conducted from this computerized data to investigate how one child acquired /stop + liquid/ clusters in initial word position. These studies seek to clarify the interaction between how often a sound is used in spontaneous speech and how it is phonetically realized. The preliminary studies suggest that during the overall acquisition process, each initial consonant and consonant cluster individually moves from one acquisition stage to the next. They may or may not be synchronized and occur either within or between natural consonant classes. ({SW})},

Analysis was based on a phonetically transcribed corpus of 6,659 utterances of 6 normally developing infants obtained from one-hour weekly audio-recordings over a 4–6 month period. Intrasyllabic predictions were that front vowels would preferentially co-occur with front (alveolar) consonants, back vowels with back (velar) consonants, and central vowels with labial consonants, with the latter effect presumably resulting from mandibular oscillation alone. Intersyllabic predictions were for more variegation in tongue height for vowels than in front-back tongue movement, and for consonant manner changes to predominate over place changes (related primarily to mandibular oscillation). All 30 individual predictions from both hypotheses were confirmed, leading to a conception of the articulatory basis of babbling as “Frame Dominance.”},

One may view a ﬁller as an emergent transitional form; as a slot that serves as an underspeciﬁed lexical entry for the accumulation of phonological and functional information ; or as prosodic ‘ sentence padding ’. We trace the development of three ﬁllers in one English-acquiring child through seven months, from their ﬁrst appearance about 1; 9 through their re-analysis as English functors about age 2; 4. We show how the description of these ﬁllers requires an elaboration of the current framework for describing the emergence of morphology, from a one-dimensional to a multi-dimensional model. Finally, we argue that the neglect of such transitional and under-deﬁned elements gives a false picture of development, making it appear as if language development takes place in discontinuous steps.},

Both phenomena are restricted to prosodically strong positions, affecting only consonants in word-initial position or in the onsets of stressed syllables. An explanation for positional velar fronting that combines phonetic and grammatical considerations is proposed to account for the occurrence of the effect in children but not adults: the greater gestural magnitude of prosodically strong onsets in English interacts with the anatomy of the young child's vocal tract to produce coronalization of prosodically strong velars. E extended the resulting pattern to lateral gliding, which developed later and has similar grammatical conditioning but less direct phonetic motivation.},

Consistent with previous work, we ﬁnd infant-directed speech to be characterized by generally short utterances, isolated words and phrases, and large numbers of questions, but longer utterances are also found. Prosodic information provides cues to grammatical units not only at utterance boundaries, but also at utterance-internal clause boundaries. Subject–verb phrase boundaries in questions also show reliable prosodic cues, although those of declaratives do not. Prosodic information may thus play an important role in providing preverbal infants with information about the grammatically relevant word groupings. Furthermore, questions may play an important role in infants’ discovery of verb phrases in English.},

	abstract = {Many languages exhibit constraints on prosodic words, where lexical items must be composed of at least two moras of structure, or a binary foot. Demuth and Fee (1995) proposed that children demonstrate early sensitivity to word-minimality effects, exhibiting a period of vowel lengthening or vowel epenthesis if coda consonants cannot be produced. This paper evaluates this proposal by examining the development of word-final coda consonants in the spontaneous speech of four English-speaking children between the ages of one and two. Although there was no evidence of vowel lengthening, coda consonants were more accurately produced in monosyllabic target words with monomoriac vowels, suggesting earlier use of coda consonants in contexts where they can be prosodified as part of a bimoraic foot. One child also showed extensive use of vowel epenthesis and coda consonant aspiration concurrent with the production of codas. However, we show that this was due to the articulatory challenges of producing complex syllable structures rather than an attempt to produce well-formed minimal words. These results suggest that learners of English may exhibit an early awareness of moraic structure at the level of the syllable, but that language-specific constraints regarding word-minimality may be acquired later than originally thought.},

Two fundamental methodological questions concerning research on consonant acquisition are (1) how to elicit a representative sample of productions and (2) how to analyse this sample once it has been collected. This paper address these two questions by reviewing relevant aspects of experience in evaluating word-initial consonant accuracy from transcriptions of isolated-word productions elicited from 2- and 3-year-olds learning four different first languages representing a telling range of consonant systems (English, Cantonese, Greek, Japanese). It is suggested that both researchers and clinicians should consider a number of different item-related factors, such as phonotactic probability and word length, when constructing word lists to elicit consonant productions from young children. This study also proposes that transcription should be supplemented by acoustic analysis and the perceptual judgements of naive listeners.},

              , Hirsh-Pasek, Treiman \& Schneiderman 1984). The present study expanded on this research by broadening the definition of ‘negative feedback’ and by describing individual styles of mother–child dialogues. The purpose was to investigate whether mothers of four 2-year-old children responded differentially to their children's well-formed or ill-formed utterances with explicit and implicit feedback. The middle-class, English-speaking, mother–child dyads were recorded in a naturalistic context at home during play and eating activities. Explicit and implicit feedback were different in terms of the proportion of responses available to the child and their relation to well-formed and ill-formed utterances. The style of response was similar for most analyses across the four mothers.},

	abstract = {Recent research shows that preschool children are skilled classifiers, using categories both to organize information efficiently and to extend knowledge beyond what is already known. Moreover, by 2 1/2 years of age, children are sensitive to nonobvious properties of categories and assume that category members share underlying similarities. Why do children expect categories to have this rich structure, and how do children appropriately limit this expectation to certain domains (i.e., animals vs. artifacts)? The present studies explore the role of maternal input, providing one of the first detailed looks at how mothers convey information about category structure during naturalistic interactions. Forty-six mothers and their 20- or 35-month-old children read picture books together. Sessions were videotaped, and the resulting transcripts were coded for explicit and implicit discussion of animal and artifact categories. Sequences of gestures toward pictures were also examined in order to reveal the focus of attention and implicit links. drawn between items. Results indicate that mothers provided a rich array of information beyond simple labeling routines. Taxonomic categories were stressed in subtle and indirect ways, in both speech and gesture, especially for animals. Statements and gestures that linked two pictures were more frequent for taxonomically related animal pictures than for other picture pairs. Mothers also generalized category information using generic noun phrases, again more for animals than for artifacts. However, mothers provided little explicit discussion of nonobvious similarities, underlying properties, or inductive potential among category members. These data suggest possible mechanisms by which a notion of kind is conveyed in the absence of detailed information about category essences.},

Mother–infant dyads were videotaped at ages 9, 12, and 30 months. Language comprehension (at 12 and 18 months) was measured by parent report and correlated with an independent language measure. Three maternal style variables were reduced from the 9-month data. Only caregivers’ contingent comments ({CCC}) related to infants’ later language. These findings held after infants’ skill with coordinated joint attention ({CJA}) was taken into account. The total number of words the mothers used when their infants were 9 months predicted vocabulary; however, the predictive power was encapsulated in the words the mother used during {CCC}. Because studies have typically examined maternal input once infants’ {CJA} has emerged, this work contributes to current efforts to understand variations in early language development.},
